# Contributing

You may feel free to contribute to the project, but:
 - Use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
    * branch: `<type>/<pr-title>` (e.g. feat/added-foo-bar)
    * commit: `<type>: <description>` (e.g. feat: Added foo bar)
 - If you create/modify frontend pages, the design must be alike
 - Do not create vulnerabilities (we work with roblox cookies)
