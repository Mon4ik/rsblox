## Why

1. Roblox Website is bloated: analytics, metrics, useless HTTP requests, etc.
2. Old design _(lets be honest, it sucks)_
3. I wanted to practice with my Rust/Vue skills
4. **Because I can**â„¢ ðŸ•º

## Why `rsblox`

**Rust** + **Roblox** = **rsblox**

## Installation

1. get rust, nodejs
2. setup [tauri environment](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites)
3. install `tauri-cli`
   ```shell
   cargo install tauri-cli
   ```
4. build it [(see more)](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/building/)
   ```shell
   cargo tauri build
   ```
5. do push-ups while building executable ðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ª
6. run it!
